This is the top level readme for the NEURON models associated with the
paper:

Hsu CL, Zhao X, Milstein AD, Spruston N (2018) Persistent sodium
current mediates the steep voltage dependence of spatial coding in
hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Neuron 99, 1–16

These models were based on previously published models (as described
in the paper). The simulations serve as independent tests for the
proposed mechanism underlying the synaptic amplification observed in
our experiments.

These models require that the NEURON simulation environment is
installed, which is freely available from http://neuron.yale.edu

To run the simple model see the instructions in the readme in the
SimpleModel folder, and for the full model (which is also available at
the github repo https://github.com /neurosutras/nap) see the readme in
the FullModel folder.

These models were contributed by Ching-Lung Hsu
(hsuc@janelia.hhmi.org) and Aaron Milstein (aaronmil@stanford.edu).
